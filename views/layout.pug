              | My experience has been built up in both retail and sales
              | roles where I have learnt to make clients feel welcome and valued. I understand that first impressions count and that
              | maintaining high levels of service from beginning to end is very important also. I believe that treating customers with
              | honesty and integrity is vital if we are to maintain their trust. 
              | I consider myself a lifelong learner as it is of paramount importance to stay motivated to pursue one's goals.
              | In recent times I have developed a strong interest in web development, which led me to learn as much as I can about frontend and backend technologies to find a permanent role in this new exciting field.
